# pydantic-cwe
`pydantic-cwe` provides a structured, object-oriented way to work with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. 
By modeling CWE entries as Pydantic objects, this library enables developers and security researchers to 
programmatically access, validate, and manipulate CWE data with ease. Ideal for static analysis tools, vulnerability 
scanners, or custom security pipelines.
